# Robin Build Status

Persistent engineering handoff. Update this file after every completed phase and at the end of every session.

## Current Date
2026-10-09

## Repository State
- Phase 1–5 commits: `72d18fd`, `f8008c3`, `aecc7e9`, `a32c2da`, `48b7d56`.
- Phase 6 original implementation: `f0511fb` (`feat: add human review queue for application decisions`).
- Phase 6 hardening is isolated on branch `phase6-review-queue-hardening`, based on `f0511fb`.
- Do not infer the state of a separate Windows working tree from this GitHub branch.

## Completed Phases
| Phase | Commit | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Hard filtering before semantic matching | `72d18fd` | Previously reported passing: 460 tests |
| 2 — Semantic skill matching (three-tier) + V029 cache | `f8008c3` | Previously reported passing: 496 tests |
| 3 — Secondary provider parallel fan-out | `aecc7e9` | Previously reported passing: 499 tests |
| 4 — Rate-limit / cost / quota engine + V030 | `a32c2da` | Previously reported passing: 512 tests |
| 5 — Automatic application decision + V031 | `48b7d56` | Previously reported passing: 621 backend tests |
| 6 — Human review queue + V032 | `f0511fb` | Previous session reported backend 628/0/0, frontend 173/173 + build, worker 19/19 |
| 6 — Review lifecycle hardening + V033 | Latest commit on hardening branch | Await CI verification |

## Phase 6 Implementation and Hardening
- `V032__review_queue_lifecycle.sql` adds `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`, `PAUSED`, and `EXPIRED`, plus `reviewed_at` and `application_id`.
- `V033__review_decision_audit_metadata.sql` additively records reviewer attribution, rejection rationale, update timestamps, and an owner/update index. Earlier migrations are not rewritten.
- The owner-scoped review API returns a pending count and score, recommendation, hard-filter outcome/reasons, mode/reason, application/preparation state, and timestamps.
- Approval uses the existing idempotent application preparation pipeline, links the application, and writes audit/outbox outcome events. It does not submit to the employer.
- Rejection records terminal state, acting account, timestamp and reason, plus audit and outbox notification events. State transitions check owner and expected state.
- Replayed match events cannot overwrite already-resolved decisions. Soft-deleted jobs are excluded; postings not seen for 30 days are flagged and approval is refused until refreshed, as is approval when the application URL is missing.
- The UI includes pending count, job/filter/application/preparation details, and an optional rejection reason.
- Authentication, owner isolation, worker auth, CSRF rules and the `REAL_SUBMIT` hard stop must remain intact.

## Verification
- The Phase 6 test counts above are reported results from the previous coding session; not rerun by the GitHub connector.
- Added integration assertions check the queue data, persisted rejection actor/reason and outbox outcome. Verify this hardening commit's CI before treating it as passing.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs backend `mvn -B verify`, worker `npm test`, frontend `npx tsc -b`, `npm test`, and `npm run build`.
- A successful CI run does not prove production deployment.

## Production State (last reported; not re-verified here)
- Reported backend: `https://job-agent-mwhu.onrender.com`; frontend: `https://job-agent-beige.vercel.app`.
- Earlier report: Stripe Greenhouse discovery ingested approximately 714–718 postings on a 15-minute schedule, and worker claim-next returned 204 when idle.
- Current live backend/frontend SHA and whether this branch has been deployed are unverified.
- `REAL_SUBMIT` remains intentionally disabled; do not report an application submitted without employer confirmation.

## Remaining Phases
7 Auto-approval rule engine · 8 Production PDF · 9 Real Greenhouse submission (gated) · 10 Cross-source dedup · 11 Workday · 12 Lever · 13 Real mailbox/OTP · 14 User search · 15 URL extraction · 16 Source catalogue · 17 Region-aware discovery · 18 Recruiter email intelligence · 19 Follow-ups · 20 Analytics · 21 Dashboard completion · 22 Bulk ops · 23 Webhooks · 24 PWA/extension/MCP.

## Next Exact Task
Only after Phase 6 hardening CI passes, resume Phase 7 if requested: configurable approval rules that respect mode, thresholds, quota, hard stops, supported ATS fields and artifact integrity. Rules must not override MANUAL mode or a hard stop.

## Last Verified Baseline
- Original Phase 6 commit: `f0511fb`.
- Previous session-reported test results: backend 628/0/0; worker 19/19; frontend 173/173 + build.
- Check the new commit's CI and run `git status --short` in the Windows checkout before merge/deploy.
